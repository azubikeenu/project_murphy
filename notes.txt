 SERVICE DISCOVERY AND SERVICE REGISTRY
 ==============================================
 The process of automatically detecting devices and services on a network is called "Service Discovery"
 Devices are called Microservices clients or Eureka Clients and the Discovery Service or the machine that handles the
 Registering of services is called the Eureka server, It knows all client application that are running on each port and IP addresses

 Whenever a service needs to talk to another service , they basically lookup the eureka server by sending a Service Discovery Request
 and the Eureka server sends back the address to the client/service

 One of the caveats of using Eureka Server is that it introduces a single point of failure

 For eureka server , Spring cloud uses

  <dependency>
             <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
             <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server</artifactId>
         </dependency>


For clients

 <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
        </dependency>



      An example of using service discovery for msc communication is

      var response = restTemplate.getForObject("http://APPLICATION_NAME/uri", ResponseClass.class , [optional path-params])

      to configure RestTemplate to perform loadbalancing

     @Configuration
     public class RestTemplateConfig {
         @Bean
         @LoadBalanced
         public RestTemplate restTemplate(){
         return new RestTemplate()
         }

      }


========================================================
                SPRING OPEN_FEIGN
 =======================================================

 OpenFeign is an HttpBased request binder that abstracts communication between microservices . It works by processing annotations
 into an templatized request


  <dependency>
             <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
             <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-openfeign</artifactId>
         </dependency>

  Example

1)
  @FeignClient(value = "fraud", path = "/api/v1/fraud-check")
  public interface FraudClient {
      @GetMapping(value = "{customerId}")
      ResponseEntity<FraudCheckResponse> isFraudster(@PathVariable("customerId") Integer customerId);
  }

2)
  @FeignClient("fraud")
  public interface FraudClient {
      @RequestMapping(method = RequestMapping.GET , value = " "/api/v1/fraud-check/{customerId}")
      ResponseEntity<FraudCheckResponse> isFraudster(@PathVariable("customerId") Integer customerId);
  }


  At the main class of the client consuming the feign client add the annotation
  @EnableFeignClients(basePackages = "com.azubike.clients")

  to use fraudClient

  const response = fraudClient.isFraudStar(customerId)

  SPRING CLOUD SLEUTH AND ZIPKIN
  ================================================

  Spring Cloud Sleuth provides Spring Boot auto-configuration for distributed tracing.
  NB . starting with spring boot 3.* and spring cloud newer version
  distributed tracing has been moved  to  Micrometer Tracing [https://micrometer.io/docs/tracing]


  Adds trace and span ids to the Slf4J MDC [Mapped Diagnostic Context], so you can extract all the logs
  from a given trace or span in a log aggregator such as .

  Instruments common ingress and egress points from Spring applications (servlet filter, rest template, scheduled actions, message
  channels, feign client).

  If spring-cloud-sleuth-zipkin is available then the app will generate and report Zipkin-compatible traces via HTTP.
  By default it sends them to a Zipkin collector
  service on localhost (port 9411). Configure the location of the service using spring.zipkin.baseUrl.

  Zipkin is a distributed tracing system that allows us gather timing data that is require to troubleshoot and stop latency problems
  in service architectures

  For a request , the trace-id remains the same through out the entire lifecycle, while the span-id changes from service to service

          <dependency>
              <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
              <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-sleuth</artifactId>
          </dependency>

          <dependency>
              <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
              <artifactId>spring-cloud-sleuth-zipkin</artifactId>
          </dependency>

                 LOAD BALANCERS
    ==========================================================
    Load balancers create a single point of entry to our application , acts as a proxy , and also helps distribute traffic
    across different microservices
     Some of the concerns when setting up a load balancer includes
     TLS
     Certificate Management
     Security/Authentication
     High Availability and Health Checks
     Logging
     Caching
     Path Based Routing


     ===============================================
     SPRING CLOUD GATEWAY
     ==============================================
     Spring handles Api Gateway and load balancing using the Spring Cloud Gateway .This acts as the single point of entry to
     our applications and addresses cross cutting concerns such as monitoring ,resiliency and  security

====================================================
AMQP(Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)
=====================================================
This allows client applications to communicate with conforming message brokers
Message Brokers receive messages from  publishers and route them to consumers


==========================================
        DOCKER
 =========================================
Docker is a linux runtime environment which is used to run containers, They facilitate easy
building and shipment of container , they create an agnostic environment where an instance
of your application can be run .Docker greatly supports "Build once and run everywhere"

Containers are an instance of our running application or an instance of an Image
While an image contains set of instructions ,application source code and libraries needed to
build containers,Images are blueprints for running containers
